The new year brings new opportunities for learning and professional development.
 
Western is offering a six-week bootcamp for faculty members called “Data Science Without Tears” - part of ongoing efforts to help build data acumen across campus.
 
The free course takes only eight hours per week over six weeks and will cover the basics of data science. The course includes practical, hands-on exercises in Python notebooks, which are essential tools for data science work that can be accessed through your browser with no setup needed!
 
The course is designed to be accessible and not intimidating for those new to data science. No tears here!
 
The bootcamp will help you:
 
- Understand how to scale your research using simple data science tools and techniques
- Automate your data collection and processing in a re-producible workflow
- Summarize and visualize your research
- Understand common machine learning models and how they may apply to your own research
 
Are you ready to take your research to the next level with a better understanding of data science?

## Learning Outcomes

Participants will:

- be empowered by their understanding of the general breadth of data science and its applications, advantages, and limitations
- acquire technical skills regarding data science, such as how to acquire data from a variety of sources, how to use Python to organize and analyze data, and how to create basic illustrations.
- be prepared to further their knowledge in the techniques relevant to their own research
- be able to evaluate the real-world data, analysis, and visualizations that they encounter in scholarly and mainstream contexts
- recognize social and ethical implications of data science, including privacy concerns and potential biases, in a broad variety of contexts.
work together with a broad community of interdisciplinary scholars to discuss data science.

## Evaluation

Upon successful completion of this boot camp, participants will be awarded a certificate. To earn this certificate, participants must complete a series of activities and challenges related to Data Science. There will be a range of activities covering data cleaning, modelling, visualization, ethics, etc., and participants will be free to choose the activities that are relevant to them. 

## Session Schedule

1. **Introduction to Data Science and a Gentle Start to Python**
    - A brief overview of what data science is and the models that it uses.
    - Examples of data science from real life.
    - :snake: A basic introduction to python code (in the form of Jupyter Notebooks :books:).
2. **Data Principles and Practices: Processing, Cleaning, Visualizing**
    - Where does data come from? Where does data go? Where does data come from, Cotton Eye'd Joe?
    - The unglorious part of data science: checking for typos in your data :cold_sweat:.
    - :snake: A basic introduction to visualization using `Matplotlib` :bar_chart: and data cleaning using `pandas` :panda_face:.
3. **Introduction to Statistics**
    - Linear models are king :crown:.
    - In order to make models, we need to make assumptions :game_die: (e.g. the Normal Distribution).
    - :snake: A basic introduction to modelling with `sklearn` :microscope:.
4. **Applied Statistical Concepts**
    - Using cross-validation to test how well your model predicts data that it didn't know about :crystal_ball:.
    - Transforming your data so your computer can learn more about it :crown:.
    - :snake: More python example code.
5. **Introduction to Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence**
    - Linear models are still king :crown: (but now they're called logistic regression).
    - Neural networks are just a bunch of logistic regressions :crown:.
    - :snake: Examples of various machine learning algorithms in `sklearn`.
6. **Worked Examples, Conclusions, and Further Steps**
    - Data analyses the whole way through :crown:.
    - :snake: How to communicate the results of a model (especially with Jupyter Notebooks :books:).
    - :mortar_board: The wisest people know that they know nothing: How to learn data science techniques that will be relevant to your research.

# Navigation Information

This is the public-facing repository for this bootcamp. Once you've registered for the boocamps (and a GitHub account), you'll be able to see (most of) the content here on GitHub.

For the activities and assessments, we may ask you to submit work by uploading them to a GitHub repository. You'll need to create this repository as a part of the DS-Without-Tears organization. Please see the file CreatingGitHubRepos.md for a description of this process.
